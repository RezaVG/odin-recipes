    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Sofrito is the base for most Puerto Rican dishes, and this one is better than store-bought (it's difficult to find in the stores in the western United States). This can be added to beans, rice, soups, and stews; you name it.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>10 ajies dulces peppers, tops removed</li>
        <li>4 onions, cut into large chunks</li>
        <li>3 medium tomatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>2 green bell peppers, seeded and chopped</li>
        <li>1 red bell peppers, seeded and chopped</li>
        <li>3 medium heads garlic, peeled</li>
        <li>25 cilantro stems (with leaves)</li>
        <li>25 recao stems (with leaves)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Combine ajies dulces peppers, onions, tomatoes, green peppers, red peppers, and garlic in a food processor; pulse a few times. Add cilantro stems, recao stems, salt, and pepper. Process until a semi-chunky salsa (not watery) consistency is reached.</li>
        <li>Store in a resealable plastic freezer bag. Use as needed or freeze in portions.</li>
    </ol>
